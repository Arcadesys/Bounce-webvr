# Bounce - Interactive Ball Physics

A 3D bouncing ball physics generator with optional VR support, inspired by old-school bouncing ball MIDI generators.

## Features

- Drop balls by clicking anywhere on the screen
- Create walls by holding Shift and dragging from one point to another
- Watch balls bounce with realistic physics and collision detection
- Audio feedback for bounce events (can be toggled on/off)
- Accessible design with audio cues
- Mobile support (touch to drop balls)

## Controls

- **Click** to drop a ball
- **Shift + Click + Drag** to create a wall
- Click the ðŸ”Š button to toggle sound on/off

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Future Plans

- VR support
- MIDI generation based on ball collisions
- More complex physics interactions
- Multiple ball types with different properties
- Save and load custom layouts
